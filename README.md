| shell.lua | /run | Executes shell commands on the host operating system. |

## Style {#Style}
Bot output from every plugin should follow a consistent style. This style is easily observed interacting with the bot.
Titles should be either **bold** (along with their colons) or a [link](http://otou.to) (with plaintext colons) to the content's source. Names should be _italic_. Numbered lists should use bold numbers followed by a bold period followed by a space. Unnumbered lists should use the â€¢ bullet point followed by a space. Descriptions and information should be in plaintext, although "flavor" text should be italic. Technical information should be `monospace`. Links should be named.
